      {
        question: "How does Gimmie AI work?",
        answer: "Gimmie AI uses advanced artificial intelligence to understand your gift-giving needs. Simply describe who you're shopping for, the occasion, and your budget, and we'll provide personalized recommendations from thousands of products across the web."
      },
      {
        question: "Is Gimmie free to use?",
        answer: "Yes! Gimmie is completely free for consumers. We make money by earning small commissions when you purchase recommended products, but this never affects the price you pay."
      },
      {
        question: "How accurate are your recommendations?",
        answer: "Our AI is trained on millions of successful gift-giving scenarios and customer reviews. We continuously improve our recommendations based on user feedback and purchase patterns to ensure high accuracy."

    questions: [
      {
        question: "Can I get recommendations for any budget?",
        answer: "Absolutely! Whether you're looking to spend $10 or $1000+, our AI will find great options within your budget. Just specify your price range when you search."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you have recommendations for all occasions?",
        answer: "Yes, we cover all major gift-giving occasions including birthdays, holidays, weddings, graduations, anniversaries, housewarming parties, and more. We also help with 'just because' gifts!"
      },
      {
        question: "What if I don't like the recommendations?",
        answer: "You can always refine your search by providing more specific details about the recipient's interests, hobbies, or preferences. The more information you give us, the better our recommendations become."
      }
    ]

  {
    title: "Shopping & Purchasing",
    icon: Heart,
    questions: [
      {
        question: "Where do I actually buy the recommended products?",
        answer: "We partner with major retailers like Amazon, Target, Etsy, and many others. When you click on a recommendation, you'll be taken directly to the retailer's website to complete your purchase."
      },
      {
        question: "Are the prices shown accurate?",
        answer: "We strive to show the most current prices, but prices can change frequently. The final price will always be confirmed on the retailer's website before you complete your purchase."
      },
      {
        question: "What if something goes wrong with my order?",
        answer: "Since you purchase directly from the retailer, any issues with shipping, returns, or customer service should be handled through them. However, if you need help finding their contact information, we're happy to assist!"
